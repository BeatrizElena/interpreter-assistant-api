### signup

The `create` action expects a *POST* of `credentials` identifying a new user to
 create, e.g. using `getFormFields`:

```html
<form>
  <input name="credentials[first_name]" type="text" value="Jane">
  <input name="credentials[last_name]" type="text" value="Doe">
  <input name="credentials[email]" type="text" value="an@example.email">
  <input name="credentials[password]" type="password" value="an example password">
  <input name="credentials[password_confirmation]" type="password" value="an example password">
</form>

```

or using `JSON`:

```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "an@example.email",
    "password": "an example password",
    "password_confirmation": "an example password"
  }
}
```

The `password_confirmation` field is optional.

If the request is successful, the response will have an HTTP Status of 201,
 Created, and the body will be JSON containing the `id` and `email` of the new
 user, e.g.:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "an@example.email"
  }
}

</form>
```

or:

```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "email": "an@example.email",

  }
}
```

If the request is successful, the response will have an HTTP Status of 200 OK,
 and the body will be JSON containing the user's `id`, `email`, and the `token`
 used to authenticate other requests, e.g.:

```json

  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "an@example.email",
